Shooter Development Plan (Staged, Testable)

Stage 1: Open-Loop Flywheel (Complete)
- Shooter subsystem runs motors in open-loop.
- Basic stop command.

Stage 2: Basic Telemetry (Complete)
- Encoder RPM values published to SmartDashboard.

Stage 3: Closed-Loop Velocity Control (Complete)
- Spark MAX closed-loop PID + feedforward.
- RPM setpoints with clamping to kMaxRpm_Motor.

Stage 4: Readiness Check (Complete)
- isAtSpeed() with tolerance (kRpmTolerance).
- "Shooter Ready" SmartDashboard indicator.

Stage 5: Feeder Integration (Complete)
- Manual feed command.
- Gated feed command (only when at speed).

Stage 6: Distance Mapping (Complete)
- Nearest lookup and interpolated lookup for distance presets.
- Both RPM (closed-loop) and voltage (open-loop) modes.

Stage 7: Testing Layout vs Competition Layout (In Progress)
- Testing keypad exposes multiple algorithms.
- Competition layout will collapse to one chosen method.

Stage 8: Intake + Climber Integration (Planned)
- Add intake raise/lower and forward/reverse commands.
- Add climber up/down commands with limit safety.

Stage 9: Calibration & Tuning (Planned)
- Gather distance-to-RPM data.
- Tune kP/kFF and verify shot consistency.
