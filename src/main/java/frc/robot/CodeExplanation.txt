FRC 2026 Shooter Robot Code Explanation
=======================================

1. Project Overview
-------------------
This project is a Command-Based WPILib robot program designed to control a flywheel shooter mechanism. It demonstrates:
- Hardware abstraction using Subsystems.
- Action logic using Commands.
- REVLib 2026 Spark MAX control and configuration.
- Debouncing for the limit switch.

2. Architecture Breakdown
-------------------------

A. RobotContainer (The Binder)
   - Location: src/main/java/frc/robot/RobotContainer.java
   - Function: Instantiates subsystems and operator interface devices, then maps buttons to commands.
   - It does not contain periodic logic; it only declares bindings.
   - Operator Xbox and keypad bindings are enabled via Constants.OI flags.

B. ShooterSubsystem (The Hardware Owner)
   - Location: src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/ShooterSubsystem.java
   - Owns the shooter motors and limit switch.
   - Exposes simple methods so commands do not touch hardware directly.

C. Commands (The Actions)
   - Location: src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/
   - SetShooterRpm: One-shot RPM setpoint.
   - StopShooter: One-shot stop.
   - RunShooterUntilStopped: Runs until interrupted.
   - SetShooterRpmByDistance: Uses distance lookup (RPM or Voltage).
   - RunFeederManual: Feeder runs while scheduled.
   - RunFeederWhenAtSpeed: Feeder runs only when isAtSpeed() is true.

3. Button Bindings (Summary)
----------------------------
Operator Xbox (USB port 1 by default):
- A: Low RPM
- B: Mid RPM
- Y: High RPM (runs until interrupted)
- X: Stop shooter
- Left Bumper: Manual feed (hold)
- Right Bumper: Gated feed (hold, only at speed)
- D-pad Up/Left/Right: Distance RPM (Far/Mid/Near)
- Start/Back/Right Stick: Distance Voltage (Far/Mid/Near)
- D-pad Down/Left Trigger/Right Trigger: Distance RPM interpolated (Mid/Near/Far)

Keypad (USB port 1 by default):
- Testing layout exposes multiple shooting methods.
- Planned competition layout is documented in RobotContainer comments.

4. Control Logic Highlights
---------------------------
- Closed-loop RPM control uses Spark MAX PID + feedforward.
- Open-loop voltage mode is available for testing and comparison.
- isAtSpeed() is used to gate feeder operation.

5. Hardware Map
---------------
- CAN ID 27: Leader Motor (Spark MAX)
- CAN ID 23: Follower Motor (Spark MAX)
- CAN ID 28: Feed Motor (Spark MAX)
- DIO Port 0: Limit Switch
- USB Port 0: Driver Xbox (always present)
- USB Port 1: Operator Xbox or Keypad (configurable)

6. Autonomous
-------------
RobotContainer.getAutonomousCommand() returns:
  new PrintCommand("No autonomous command configured")

There is no autonomous behavior yet.
